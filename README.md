# Sentiment-Classification-of-IMDb-Reviews-
Build an end-to-end NLP pipeline to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

Dataset: 

Use the IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset or any labeled sentiment dataset. 

Requirements: 

• Define the classification goal and success metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score). 
• Preprocess text: clean, tokenize, and vectorize using TF-IDF or embeddings 
(Word2Vec, BERT). 
• Train at least two models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, LSTM, Transformer
based). 
• Use cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. 
• Build a modular pipeline using scikit-learn, spaCy, or Hugging Face.
